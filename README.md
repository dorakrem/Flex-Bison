# Compiler build of an XML-like programming language

Created a compiler and a parser using the tools Flex and Bison for lexical and grammar
analysis.

1. Description of the language in BNF
* The language syntax and grammar were defined using Backus-Naur Form (BNF). This formal notation was essential for specifying the language's structure and rules.
2. Use of Flex and Bison tools
* Flex (Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator): Used for generating the lexical analyzer. Flex scans the input text and breaks it down into tokens, which are the basic building blocks of the language.
* Bison (GNU Parser Generator): Used for generating the parser. Bison takes the tokens produced by Flex and organizes them according to the grammar defined in BNF, creating a parse tree that represents the syntactic structure of the input.
3. Creation of Pseudo-code for a language that followed same grammar and syntax rules as XML
* Developed pseudo-code for the custom language that followed the same grammar and syntax rules as XML. This pseudo-code helped in visualizing and testing the compilerâ€™s functionality.

# Technologies and Frameworks:
* Flex: For generating the lexical analyzer.
* Bison: For generating the parser.
* Sublime Text: As the text editor for writing code and configurations.
* C: The programming language used for implementing the compiler.
* Cygwin Terminal: Used to provide a Unix-like environment and command-line interface on Windows, facilitating the compilation and testing processes.
